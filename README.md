## Useage

All the results from the paper are from the ipython notebook `learning_viral_defense.ipynb`. Requirements for running are can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Models should take no more than an hour to train individually on a regular laptop. To save png sequence outputs of simulations, you must create a subdirectory of images. Pre-trained models are in the models directory and are loaded in the ipython notebook.
